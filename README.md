# The Particle-based Cognition Engine
*A new perspective on artificial intelligence*


## Summary

This project is an attempt to build a new type of neural network designed entirely around experiential learning - building knowledge through experiences. 


## Background

This all started around the fall of 2024, when I downloaded and set up my first local model, Mistral 7b Instruct v02 (the same model mainly used for testing), from Huggingface and began down my path of local AI development. 

I originally wanted to create my own memory system for locally installed LLMs, to establish a persistent and consistently growing memory and identity across sessions; but when I started to work on this, I learned that LLMs are designed to have their memory/weights be updated offline (fine-tuning). This led me to the idea "What if there was an architecture that allowed for dynamic real-time weight updates?" and here I am a year later attempting to build one.

I must warn you, I have no formal background in this department. I didn't go to college for computer science, as much as I wish I did. I've been working with VSC Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4) throughout the creation of this project, and you will see a combination of AI generated and my own created code, but this has mainly been an educational journey for me.

This project was made over the course of a year and the combination and revision of multiple other projects, all created under the same goals and intention (we love adhd).
